# TUN-RiseAgainstHunger
Teradata Data Challenge 2017, Rise Against Hunger Report

Rise Against Hunger is an NGO that aims to stop hunger across the world. It packages and sends meals
all over the world. As a part of our Data Warehousing coursework, we got to work on their data and provide
some ideas based on our analysis. We chose to answer the following questions, Who are their recurring
Donors? And Do the giving amounts increases or decreases vary based on donor level? What are
the levels ($ amount cutoffs)? Our analysis gave us an insight into the recurring donors as well as
additional information about them. This information can be used to increase their donations and help them
move closer towards their goal.
